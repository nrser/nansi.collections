`nansi.admin.humans` Role
==============================================================================

For the moment, seems this needs to stay a role (as opposed to being converted
into an action plugin) because it switches users, and I haven't got that to 
work in action compositions yet (haven't tried much either, 2021-01-04).

The Git and GitHub stuff prob could/should be broken out into actions, but just
gonna punt on the whole enchilada for now.
